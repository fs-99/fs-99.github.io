What it says in the title.

The endless feature bloat that all big tech companies go after is a problem of company scaling. When your engineers (maybe designers) are mostly "done" with the product, they have to invent new ways to keep money flowing, lest they have to find a new, real problem to solve.

There is no reason to force the automatic application of a status on discord users who enter a voice channel.
The only excuse to do so is to show off power. Maybe to mold users into "chillers", maybe a bit to force them to use the feature.
Maybe a bit to stir controversy, because all publicity is good publicity for huge monopolies.
