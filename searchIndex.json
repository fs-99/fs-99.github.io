When your engineers (maybe designers) are mostly &quot;done&quot; with the product, they have to invent new ways to keep money flowing, lest they have to find a new, real problem to solve.\nThere is no reason to force the automatic application of a status on discord users who enter a voice channel.\nThe only excuse to do so is to show off power. Maybe to mold users into &quot;chillers&quot;, maybe a bit to force them to use the feature.\nMaybe a bit to stir controversy, because all publicity is good publicity for huge monopolies.",

		"url":"/rescuing-is-about-planning/",
		"content": "Do you think you can rescue the world without planning?\nWould you try to rescue your family without a plan in which you are confident is the best possible one?\nThe one with the best weights, not hurting your family, not costing everything you have, not taking too long (the longer the implementation of a plan takes, the more possible risks of chaos stepping in)?\nYou definitely need a plan. And planning is about experimentation at low cost, to gain experience. If you don't have time, you hire someone who already has that experience.\nSoftware in a development state has low costs.\nPrototypes have low cost.\nModels of the problem and some types of simulation have low cost.\nSimulate all the ways, as deep as you can.\nI like referring not only to logical constructs to explain stuff here, so have this random connection about &quot;planning&quot;:\nGod's plan.\nYou might connect &quot;God's plan&quot; to some pop culture stuff, but the root of the concept is the christian branding of determinism. God somehow gives you some &quot;fate&quot;.\nBut if you take another christian concept, the possession by demons, you will notice that when you're thinking, you cannot (always) be sure if &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Demon&quot; talks to you. In some cases it's pretty obvious, when you're indulging in something for example. In any way, if you follow the demonic route, it will lead you to a pretty bad &quot;fate&quot;.\nThat's why I would argue &quot;God's plan&quot; is something which can either be fulfilled by anyone, in a very real way, similar to Jesus or it's something you're called to do, but which you have to follow by walking the good way.\nFate can be any way, &quot;God's plan&quot; would be the real, good way.\nThat kinda puts too much logic into it, but then again, what's the definition of a plan? :)\nAnother interesting aspect of this is that you can see pretty much any plan as a rescue operation. If it doesn't fit that, at least for now I think it's probably indulgence. Are you saving your health? Your future? Your time? In an abstract sense, value? How much value?\nIs your plan of buying a lambo instead of having kids at some point saving you enough value?\nI have not thought about writing this, I just did it because some random guy on discord told me my articles look great. Then I randomly thought of the title. Then I thought of &quot;rescuing the world&quot;. Then I thought about selling the title, when I came up with a sort of family-hostage situation. The other concepts came from a great book I'm currently reading, &quot;How Big Things Get Done&quot;.\nThen I randomly wanted to watch+listen to an interesting Matrix edit I randomly found on a discord server a few months ago, which reminded me of &quot;God's plan&quot;, which is fitting the topic well, so I thought about that a bit.\nI had that idea of &quot;which is the correct voice to listen to&quot; in my mind for quite a while, because it does really get more blurry once you get to a certain age and receive more interesting decisions to make.\nThen, a few weeks ago, I watched a playthrough of &quot;The Inn-Sanity&quot;, which is a game about a few religious topics, sometimes a bit too direct, but containing interesting philosophical bits. There's that one priest which thoroughly believes god is giving him backup and telling him what to do, but in the end he seems to be under the same demonic influences as the other inhabitants.\nI still think there's something very obvious about &quot;the right way&quot;, but once you crack once or twice you might end up in a shitshow of your own thoughts and behaviors.\nYou need to reset.\nTurn it off and on again.\nYou lost. Try again.\nRecycle your thoughts.\nCross over the threshold.\nA new day's a new beginning.\nHappy new year's resolutions.\nChange your environment completely.\nMeditation resets your mind.\nRebasing your breath.\nPinch your cheeks and wake up.\nI'm saying this to you and to myself. Pick up the call and answer it.\nI need to talk to your captor.\nThe rescue plan starts with communication.",

		"content": "There is only time.\nAs a concept, &quot;free time&quot; is kind of weird.\nIt sounds like work then is &quot;jail time&quot;.\nIt also implies that work has to be shitty. I wonder how much of this notion can be put away if we really like the work we are doing and specifically take effort into shaping the kind of work we do. If you think of any cookie-cutter entrepreneur, they will most likely tell you something similar.\nOf course, this is not always possible, but I still wonder how it could be reformulated.\nThere is something to be said about responsibilities vs. rights, since free time is or should be a right, while work is generally seen as a responsibility.\nAnother similar dichotomy is between work and play, which generalizes a bit more. A &quot;right to play&quot; sounds interesting.\nAlso, play can earn you money and the more (longer!) you focus in on some play, the more opportunity to earn money from it.\n(I will write some more about work/play later, but I basically mean play as passion)\nThis gives us one observation:\nThe rich who &quot;made it&quot; can pretty much play all the time, since they can lose for far longer. This is why you will hear some say you should just follow your passion. It might be that they can't see or remember how it feels like to have to work in terms of responsibility.\nI might be wrong about that though, since a lot of the rich are leaders with tons of responsibility.\nTODO: &quot;you don't have time, you take your time&quot;",
