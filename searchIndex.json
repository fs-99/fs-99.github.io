		"content": "There is only time.\nAs a concept, &quot;free time&quot; is kind of weird.\nIt sounds like work then is &quot;jail time&quot;.\nIt also implies that work has to be shitty. I wonder how much of this notion can be put away if we really like the work we are doing and specifically take effort into shaping the kind of work we do. If you think of any cookie-cutter entrepreneur, they will most likely tell you something similar.\nOf course, this is not always possible, but I still wonder how it could be reformulated.\nThere is something to be said about responsibilities vs. rights, since free time is or should be a right, while work is generally seen as a responsibility.\nAnother similar dichotomy is between work and play, which generalizes a bit more. A &quot;right to play&quot; sounds interesting.\nAlso, play can earn you money and the more (longer!) you focus in on some play, the more opportunity to earn money from it.\n(I will write some more about work/play later, but I basically mean play as passion)\nThis gives us one observation:\nThe rich who &quot;made it&quot; can pretty much play all the time, since they can lose for far longer. This is why you will hear some say you should just follow your passion. It might be that they can't see or remember how it feels like to have to work in terms of responsibility.\nI might be wrong about that though, since a lot of the rich are leaders with tons of responsibility.\nTODO: &quot;you don't have time, you take your time&quot;",
