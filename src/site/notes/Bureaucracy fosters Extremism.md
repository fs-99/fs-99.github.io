The less powerful you feel, the more power you seek after and the more drastic measures you think of.
Bureaucracy is the system by which power is subverted upwards.
Extremism is the system by which power is taken forcefully downwards.

Bureaucracy needs *order* as one big ***mass***.
Extremism is the ***small*** swing back into *disorder*.

Do you think this is true?
When does it really trigger someone to act extremism out?
