Serotonin marks our place in the dominance (competence) hierarchy.
If anti-depressants artificially modify serotonin levels, do we artificially change the structure of the hierarchy?
If everyone were getting more and more depressed, using anti-depressants (and drugs) to counteract this fact, would it lead to a society with an inverted or skewed hierarchy?
